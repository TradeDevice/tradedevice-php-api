If you wish to create your own service (reseller) off of TradeDevice, you are permitted to do so as long as you follow our reseller terms on our website (TradeDevice.com)

Also note, you cannot submit trades through our api. This means you would have to accept the trade via our API and then manually submit it later once processed.
